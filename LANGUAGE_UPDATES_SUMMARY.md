2. `lib/email.ts` - Email templates and communications
3. `pages/plans.tsx` - Plan features and benefits

## ðŸš€ Result:
Your platform now presents itself as a **modern digital cooperative thrift society** that leverages technology to facilitate traditional Nigerian savings culture, rather than a fintech trying to disrupt the financial industry.

The language now emphasizes:
- **Community building** over financial innovation
- **Traditional thrift values** with modern convenience
- **Member cooperation** over individual financial growth
- **Steady, reliable savings** over aggressive returns

This positioning should resonate better with Nigerian users who are familiar with traditional thrift/esusu culture while still appreciating the convenience of digital tools.
