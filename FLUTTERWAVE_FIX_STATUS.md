## ðŸŽ‰ Flutterwave Integration Fixed!

### âœ… What was Fixed:
1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Added proper Flutterwave environment variable names
2. **Secret Key Error**: Created development mode bypass for testing
3. **SDK Initialization**: Added graceful handling of placeholder keys

### ðŸ§ª Development Mode Features:
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects when you're using test/development keys
- **Mock Payments**: Redirects to your test wallet page instead of real Flutterwave
- **Full Testing**: You can test wallet funding without real payment gateway integration

### ðŸš€ How to Test:
1. Go to `/fund-wallet` page
2. Click "Fund Wallet" 
3. It will redirect to your test wallet page instead of real Flutterwave
4. Use the test wallet page to simulate successful payments
5. Your wallet balance will update correctly

### ðŸ”‘ When You Get Real Keys:
Simply update your `.env` file with real Flutterwave keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_real_public_key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_real_secret_key
FLUTTERWAVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_real_encryption_key
FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HASH=your_real_webhook_secret
```

The system will automatically switch to production mode!

### ðŸ’° Current Status:
- âœ… Development server running
- âœ… Mock Flutterwave integration active
- âœ… Wallet system functional
- âœ… Payment testing ready

**Try funding your wallet now - it should work without errors!**
